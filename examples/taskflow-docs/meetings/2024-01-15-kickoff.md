## Discussion Summary

### Project Overview

David Nguyen presented the business case for TaskFlow. The product targets small-to-medium engineering teams (5--50 members) that need a lightweight, opinionated project management tool. Primary differentiators are real-time collaboration, deep GitHub/GitLab integration, and a keyboard-first interface. Market research indicates that existing tools are either too complex (Jira) or too simple (Trello) for this segment.

Revenue target: $500K ARR by end of Q4 2024, achieved through a freemium model with team-based pricing ($12/user/month for Pro, $25/user/month for Enterprise).

### Technical Architecture

Marcus Johnson presented the proposed architecture. The system consists of:

- **Frontend**: React SPA with TypeScript, deployed to Cloudflare Pages
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express) REST API, deployed to AWS ECS Fargate
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 on AWS RDS (pending ADR-001 finalization)
- **Real-time**: WebSocket server using Socket.io for live updates
- **Cache**: Redis for session management, rate limiting, and pub/sub
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with staged deployments (dev, staging, production)

Priya Patel raised concerns about the frontend build size with the current dependency set. The team agreed to establish a 200KB gzipped bundle budget and evaluate alternatives during Sprint 1.

James O'Brien confirmed that the AWS infrastructure can be provisioned using Terraform, with an estimated monthly cost of $800--$1,200 at launch scale.

### MVP Scope

David Nguyen outlined the MVP feature set after discussion with the team:

1. **Workspace management**: Create/join workspaces, invite members, assign roles (Owner, Admin, Member)
2. **Project boards**: Kanban-style boards with customizable columns and WIP limits
3. **Task CRUD**: Create, read, update, delete tasks with title, description, assignee, priority, and due date
4. **Real-time updates**: Live board updates when tasks are modified by other users
5. **Authentication**: Email/password login and Google OAuth2

Features explicitly deferred to post-MVP: custom fields, time tracking, GitHub integration, API keys, mobile apps.

### Risk Identification

The team identified the following risks:

| Risk                                  | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation                                  |
|---------------------------------------|-----------|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| WebSocket scaling under load          | Medium    | High   | Load test at 1,000 concurrent connections by Sprint 2 |
| PostgreSQL full-text search limits    | Low       | Medium | Design search abstraction layer for future Elasticsearch migration |
| Team velocity uncertainty (new team)  | High      | Medium | Conservative Sprint 1 scope, adjust after retrospective |
| Third-party OAuth2 provider changes   | Low       | Low    | Abstract OAuth2 behind provider interface    |

## Decisions Made

1. **Technology stack approved** as proposed by Marcus Johnson, pending ADR-001 and ADR-002 finalization.
2. **Sprint cadence**: 2-week sprints starting January 22, with review on the final Friday and planning on the following Monday.
3. **MVP target date**: April 15, 2024 (6 sprints).
4. **Frontend bundle budget**: 200KB gzipped maximum, enforced in CI.
5. **Definition of Done**: Code reviewed, tests passing (>80% coverage), deployed to staging, QA approved.
